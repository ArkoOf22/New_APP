Architecture
Frontend Architecture:
Components:

Login/Sign-Up Screen
Product List Screen
Product Details Screen
Cart Screen
Checkout Screen
Order Status Screen
State Management:

Store user data, product list, and cart items globally.
API Integration:

Use Axios or Fetch for communication with backend APIs.
Backend Architecture:
Controller Layer:

Handles incoming API requests.
Endpoints for user authentication, product retrieval, cart management, order placement, and order status.
Service Layer:

Business logic for handling products, orders, and payments.
Repository Layer:

Interacts with the database using JPA.
Database Tables:

Users: For storing user details.
Products: For storing product details.
Orders: For tracking orders, payment status, and delivery status.
Cart: Temporary storage for user cart data.
Payment Gateway Integration:

APIs to initiate and confirm payments.
Order Status Management:

Use WebSockets or polling to update the order status in real-time.
Workflow
Authentication:

Users log in or sign up using their email and password.
Backend validates credentials using Spring Security and generates JWT tokens.
Product Listing:

Backend fetches all available products from the database.
Frontend displays these products in a scrollable list.
Cart Management:

User adds products to the cart.
Cart data is stored locally or sent to the backend.
Order Placement:

User checks out from the cart.
Backend processes the order and updates the database.
Payment status is handled based on user selection (online or COD).
Order Status:

Status transitions from PLACED → DISPATCHED → DELIVERED.
